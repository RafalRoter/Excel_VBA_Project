## Task:
(Polish version in VBA_Project_Exercise.png)

- Implement 2 chosen methods of solving difference equations used in SIR epidemic model (our methods of choice are:
Ralston's method and Runge-Kutta 3rd order method).
- Write functions that use implemented methods to solve difference equations with initial conditions.
- Plot both functions on a graph to highlight differences between their accuracy.
- Plot few phase curves using different initial values of S and I.
- Examine the influence of base reproduction rate on that system of equations. Identify whether at limit as t goes to
infinity there is disease free equilibrium or endemic equilibrium.
